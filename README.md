# City-of-Altis
The complete mod for the City of Altis server.  
Our server is under development and we are constantly changing features and creating bugs. If you find a bug please report it on our GitHub page (https://github.com/MightySCollins/City-of-Altis)  

Although this code has not yet got a license we do not mind you using some of it for your own server but we would appreciate a mention. The original framework was designed by Tonic as you can see in most of the code and we would like to thank him for sharing his brilliant scripts and talent.
